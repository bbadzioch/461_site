1. I would recommend the website for [*Python Data Science Handbook*](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/index.html) by Jake VanderPlas.
2. No, being in basic form means that matrix is row reduced (except it is more general).
We will get back to it soon, so it should get clearer.

I will explain how to solve linear programming problems using the simplex method, which is one of the
main methods used in practice.

Yes, I will show how to do various linear algebra computations using Python. I don't assume though
that everyone in this class has programming experience. It not difficult to perform some computations
without writing fully-featured Python programs.
